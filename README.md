RPG Combat Kata
===============


In this repo there is a starting position for the [RPG Combat Kata](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/rpg_combat.html) with one failing test case that uses Approvals.
The idea is to design a Printer for a PlayerCharacter and design Approval tests for the
various scenarios as you build up the functionality.
